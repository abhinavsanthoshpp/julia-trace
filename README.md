# JuliaTrace: AI-Powered On-Chain Forensics Agent

JuliaTrace is a full-stack decentralized application built to demonstrate the power and versatility of the JuliaOS framework. It allows users to trace Solana transactions, providing a clear, human-readable forensic report powered by an AI agent.

This project was developed as a submission for the **AI DApp Development Bounty by JuliaOS** on Superteam Earn.

### ‚ñ∫ Live Demo

A live version of the dApp is deployed on Vercel:

**[https://julia-trace-zqu2.vercel.app/)**

### ## How it Uses JuliaOS

This dApp was built from the ground up to showcase the core features of the JuliaOS framework as specified in the bounty.

- **ü§ñ Agent Execution:** The core of the application is a `TracerAgent` built using the JuliaOS agent-centric design. This agent uses its `useLLM()` capability to analyze raw on-chain data and generate an intelligent, easy-to-understand summary of the transaction's purpose.

- **üåê On-Chain Functionality:** The agent connects directly to the Solana blockchain using the `useOnChain()` interface. It executes RPC calls like `getTransaction` to fetch live, real-world data, demonstrating the framework's ability to interact with smart contracts and ledgers.

- **ü§ù Swarm Integration (Concept):** The architecture is designed for swarm capabilities. The current `TracerAgent` could be paired with a `BridgeMonitorAgent` to hand off tracing duties for cross-chain events, showcasing how multiple agents could collaborate to perform a complex task.

- **üíª UI/UX Layer:** A clean, responsive frontend built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS provides an intuitive user experience, demonstrating how a custom UI can be built on top of a JuliaOS-powered backend.
